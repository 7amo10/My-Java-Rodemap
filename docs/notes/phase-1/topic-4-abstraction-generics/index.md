## :material-target: What You'll Master

- **Abstract Classes** — Abstract methods, concrete methods, when to use abstract vs interface
- **Interfaces** — Default methods, static methods, multiple inheritance of type
- **Polymorphism (Advanced)** — Expanding polymorphism with interfaces and hierarchies
- **Java Generics** — Type parameters, bounded types, wildcards (`?`, `? extends T`, `? super T`)
- **Comparators** — `Comparable` vs `Comparator`, sorting with custom logic
- **Type Erasure** — How generics work at runtime and its implications
- **Nested Classes** — Static nested classes, inner classes, local classes, anonymous classes
