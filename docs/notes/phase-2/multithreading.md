# Multithreading & Concurrency

## Core Topics

- **Thread Basics:** Creating threads (Thread class, Runnable, Callable)
- **Thread Lifecycle:** NEW, RUNNABLE, BLOCKED, WAITING, TIMED_WAITING, TERMINATED
- **Synchronization:** synchronized keyword, intrinsic locks
- **volatile Keyword:** Visibility guarantees, happens-before relationship
- **wait(), notify(), notifyAll():** Inter-thread communication
- **Locks:** ReentrantLock, ReadWriteLock, StampedLock
- **Thread Pools:** ExecutorService, ThreadPoolExecutor, ForkJoinPool
- **Concurrent Collections:** ConcurrentHashMap, CopyOnWriteArrayList, BlockingQueue
- **Atomic Variables:** AtomicInteger, AtomicReference
- **Future & CompletableFuture:** Asynchronous programming
