# JVM Internals & Memory Management

## Core Topics

### JVM Architecture
- Class Loader Subsystem (Bootstrap, Extension, Application)
- Runtime Data Areas (Method Area, Heap, Stack, PC Registers, Native Method Stack)
- Execution Engine (Interpreter, JIT Compiler, Garbage Collector)

### Class Loading Mechanism
- Loading → Linking (Verification, Preparation, Resolution) → Initialization

### Memory Management
- Heap Structure (Young Generation: Eden, Survivor; Old Generation; Metaspace)
- Stack memory and stack frames
- Method Area and Runtime Constant Pool

### JVM Monitoring & Profiling
- JVisualVM, JConsole, JProfiler, YourKit
- Java Flight Recorder (JFR)
