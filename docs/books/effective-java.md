## :material-target: Phase 1 Items to Focus On

### Creating and Destroying Objects (Items 1-9)
- Item 1: Consider static factory methods
- Item 2: Consider a builder for many parameters
- Item 3: Enforce singleton with private constructor or enum
- Item 7: Eliminate obsolete object references

### Classes and Interfaces (Items 15-25)
- Item 15: Minimize accessibility
- Item 17: Minimize mutability
- Item 18: Favor composition over inheritance
- Item 20: Prefer interfaces to abstract classes

### Generics (Items 26-33)
- Item 26: Don't use raw types
- Item 28: Prefer lists to arrays
- Item 31: Use bounded wildcards (PECS)

### Lambdas and Streams (Items 42-48)
- Item 42: Prefer lambdas to anonymous classes
- Item 43: Prefer method references to lambdas
- Item 45: Use streams judiciously
- Item 46: Prefer side-effect-free functions

### General Programming (Items 57-68)
- Item 57: Minimize scope of local variables
- Item 58: Prefer for-each loops
- Item 61: Prefer primitives to boxed primitives

## :material-book-open-variant: Reading Strategy

1. **First Pass (During Phase 1):** Read items related to fundamentals
2. **Second Pass (During Phase 2):** Read concurrency and advanced items
3. **Third Pass (During Projects):** Reference specific items as needed
4. **Ongoing:** Keep the book handy as a reference
